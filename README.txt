Show latest data about Indian Mutual Funds on your website, e.g. 1 yr, 3 yr, 5 yr returns, risk, category etc.

== Description ==

The plugin allows you to embed latest Mutual Funds (Indian) data in your blog. 

Simply install the plugin and it will make a button available in the post/page editor. Clicking on the button will allow you to search Mutual Funds.

Select from the search results to be included. The data will be displayed in a tabular format. 

Currently following data will be shown for the selected Mutual Funds -

*   Name of the Mutual Fund (linked to a description page - an external website)
*   Category e.g. Equity, Debt, ELSS etc.
*   Risk e.g. High, Moderate etc.
*   Returns â€” 1 year, 3 Years and 5 Years.
*   Expense Ratio
*   Portfolio turnover (churn ratio)

The column in the tables can be customized from the Mutual Fund Data settings section.

The plugin makes use of an external service (https://groww.in) for fetching the Mutual Fund Data. Here's the link to Groww's terms and conditions - https://groww.in/terms-and-conditions/.

Although Groww prohibits the reuse of their data, in this case they have graciously agreed to make an exception.
